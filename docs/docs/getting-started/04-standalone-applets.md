# Deploy a Standalone Applet
While you've created a simple applet for deployment on the Brains@Play Platform, this applet can also run standalone using only the internal functions and built-in fragment rendering system in our Applet Template. Simply install [our NPM library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/brainsatplay) in your project!

*Details coming soon...*
