# Setup
This guide aims to get you started with contributing.

## Requirements
### Node.js
The app ecosystem requires Node.js to build and set up prequisite software packages.

Head to [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

### A Chromium-based browser
Due to limited implementation of [Web Bluetooth](https://caniuse.com/web-bluetooth) and [WebUSB](https://caniuse.com/webusb), Brains@Play currently requires a Chromium-based web browser like [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) for development and use.

## Clone the repository
Clone the [brainsatplay](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay) repository from Github.

## Install required packages
Navigate to the root directory of the repository and run `npm install` in your terminal.

## Run the development server
Run `npm start` in terminal to build and start a development server. 

Now you're ready to get started building your first app!
