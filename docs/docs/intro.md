# Overview
**[brainsatplay.js](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay) is an open-source framework for creating brain-responsive applications using modern web technologies.** With this framework, we have developed [The Brains@Play Platform](https://app.brainsatplay.com) to streamline the deployment of applications built by and for our community.

## Why Brains@Play?
---

**Everyone has a brain.** So why not develop applications accessible to all of them? The main benefits of brainsatplay.js include:

### Device-Agnostic Data Acquisition
Stream raw data over Bluetooth Low Energy or Serial. We currently support a wide array of commercial brain-sensing devices—and are set to add new devices over time.

#### EEG
- **FreeEEG32:** FreeEEG32
- **OpenBCI:** Ganglion, Cyton, and Daisy-Cyton
- **InteraXon:** Muse 2 and Muse S

#### HEG
- **HEGAlpha:** HEGduino

#### Other
- **Neosensory:** Buzz

### Plug-and-Play Algorithms
Derive useful information from brain data in real-time—all locally on your web browser!

- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), including bandpowers
- Coherence
- Blinks

### Advanced Networking Capabilities
Securely stream brain data over the internet to support social experiences and/or remote data collection. 

### Rapid App Development
Worry less about the basics and focus on creating high-quality user experiences!

- An [SSVEP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8553012) speller ($250)
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) implementation for peer-to-peer data streaming ($250)
- [Automated artifact rejection](https://gitlab.ciirc.cvut.cz/open-source/rps) for online BCI experiments ($100)
- Unity, Unreal, and Godot plugins ($50 each)
- [Timeflux UI](https://github.com/timeflux/timeflux_ui) integration ($50)
- [BCI2000](https://www.bci2000.org/) integration via [BCI2000Web](https://github.com/cronelab/bci2000web) ($50).
- [MOABB](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb) integration ($50).
- Project [Warioware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdyq57OCXn8): "Micro-games" for single and multiplayer use ($5 per entry)

Each technical bounty must be accompanied by a demo applet showcasing the new feature.
