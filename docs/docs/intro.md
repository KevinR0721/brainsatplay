# Overview
**[brainsatplay.js](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay) is an open-source framework for creating brain-responsive applications using modern web technologies.** With this framework, we have developed [The Brains@Play Platform](https://app.brainsatplay.com) to streamline the deployment of applications built by and for our community.

## Why Brains@Play?
---

**Everyone has a brain.** So why not develop applications accessible to all of them? The main benefits of brainsatplay.js include:

### Device-Agnostic Data Acquisition
Stream raw data over Bluetooth Low Energy or Serial. We currently support a wide array of commercial brain-sensing devices—and are set to add new devices over time.

#### EEG
- **FreeEEG32:** FreeEEG32
- **OpenBCI:** Ganglion, Cyton, and Daisy-Cyton
- **InteraXon:** Muse 2 and Muse S

#### HEG
- **HEGAlpha:** HEGduino

#### Other
- **Neosensory:** Buzz

### Plug-and-Play Algorithms
Derive useful metrics from brain data in real-time—directly on the browser.

#### GPU
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), including bandpowers

#### CPU
- Coherence

### Advanced Networking Capabilities
Securely stream brain data over the internet to support social experiences and/or remote data collection. 

### Rapid App Development
Worry less about the basics and focus on creating high-quality user experiences!
