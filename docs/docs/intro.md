## Welcome to Brains@Play
---

**[brainsatplay.js](https://github.com/brainsatplay/brainsatplay) is an open-source framework for creating brain-responsive applications using modern web technologies.** With this framework, we have developed [The Brains@Play Platform](https://app.brainsatplay.com) to streamline the deployment of applications built by and for our community.


## Our Ethos
---

**The future intrastructure of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is being written openly on the Web.** [BCI2000](https://github.com/cronelab/bci2000web) and [Timeflux](https://github.com/timeflux/timeflux_ui) have already caught on. Here's why we think you should take web-based BCIs seriously.

### 1. Everyone Has A Brain
**Why not develop applications accessible to all of them?** Brains@Play creates neurotechnology with everyone by taking advantage of the universal interface of modern technology: the web browser. The Web is the only platform positioned to elevate all of society through widespread home use of neurofeedback and BCIsâ€”both by healthy users *as well as* those with neurological disorders. Our device-agnostic data acquisition system standardizes data streams from a variety of devices so you don't have to worry about compatibility when developing applications.

### 2. Code for the Client
**We want biosensing applications to seamlessly transfer from your Github repository into the real world!** Whether or not you're connected to the internet, you should always have the opportunity to receive real-time information about your brain. The development of a Javascript BCI library, affordable hardware, and experiences that truly captivate users will extend the benefits of biosensing technology to all.

### 3. Access to Brains Requires Access to Source Code
Since Brains@Play is licensed under the GPLv3 license, **you must distribute your own source code under a GPLv3-compatible license if your software includes or modifies the Brains@Play codebase.** 

A full list of licenses that qualify as free software licenses, and are compatible with the GNU GPL, can be found [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.en.html).


## Use Cases
---

You should consider using Brains@Play if you're looking to:
- Distribute a complete biosensing app on the Web
- Rapidly design a Web interface for your native biosensing app
- Network your biosensing app through the Brainstorm to support social connection and/or remote data collection

- An [SSVEP](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8553012) speller ($250)
- [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) implementation for peer-to-peer data streaming ($250)
- [Automated artifact rejection](https://gitlab.ciirc.cvut.cz/open-source/rps) for online BCI experiments ($100)
- Unity, Unreal, and Godot plugins ($50 each)
- [Timeflux UI](https://github.com/timeflux/timeflux_ui) integration ($50)
- [BCI2000](https://www.bci2000.org/) integration via [BCI2000Web](https://github.com/cronelab/bci2000web) ($50).
- Build us the [BrainDAO](https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/16/the-tao-of-the-dao-or-how-the-autonomous-corporation-is-already-here/) and create a token that you can mine with your brain ($50).
- [MOABB](https://github.com/NeuroTechX/moabb) integration ($50).
- Project [Warioware](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdyq57OCXn8): "Micro-games" for single and multiplayer use ($5 per entry)

Each technical bounty must be accompanied by a demo applet showcasing the new feature.
