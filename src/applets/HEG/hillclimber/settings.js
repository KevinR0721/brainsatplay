    <h3>Easy breathing exercises:</h3>
    <h4>Diaphragmatic Vagal Breathing (increase score):</h4>
    <p>
      Take a slow deep breath over 5 seconds, then breathe out slowly for 5 seconds. \n
      Do not try to strain yourself or hold your breath in.\n
      The breathing should feel be a natural but slow ~6 breaths per minute rhythm that pushes your belly out and your diaphragm down. \n
    </p>
    <h4>Relaxation breathing (reduces score)</h4>
    <p>
        Breathe out slowly over 7 seconds till you empty your lungs, then breathe back in for 3 seconds. \n
        Count your breaths to keep your mind occupied or focus on a point in the middle of your forehead and slowly move it down your body. \n
    </p>
    <h4>Jacobson's Progressive Muscular Relaxation Breathing</h4>
    <p>
        Another exercise is to breathe similarly to the first exercise but even slower while also tensing different muscle groups on the inhale, then relaxing them on the exhale. \n
        Start in either your upper or lower body and work your way up/down through all of your muscle groups. \n
        Tense up only once every two to three breathing cycles to give your body time to recover in-between.
