## Description
**brainsatplay.js** is full-stack framework for developing web-based brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This library abstracts the networking and data management requirements for developing functional BCI apps hosted on the web.

FYI it's super unfinished. We are reworking a few systems still to be *just* right and then completing documentation and a community website, give it a few weeks :-)


## Getting Started
### Library Usage
#### Node.js
```bash
npm install brainsatplay
``` 

##### CommonJS
```javascript
const brainsatplay = require('brainsatplay')
``` 

##### ES Modules
```javascript
import * as brainsatplay from 'brainsatplay'
```

#### Browser
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/brainsatplay"></script>
```
